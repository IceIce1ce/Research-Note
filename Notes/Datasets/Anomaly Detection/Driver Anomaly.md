<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
Driver Anomaly dataset contains normal driving videos together with a set of anomalous actions in its training set. In the test set, there are unseen anomalous actions that still need to be winnowed out from normal driving. It is the first video based open set recognition dataset for vision based driver monitoring application. The resolution of videos is 224 $\times$ 171 pixels at 45 FPS. The training set contains recordings of 25 subjects and each subject has 6 normal driving and 8 anomalous driving video recordings. Each normal driving lasts about 3.5 minutes and each anomalous driving video lasts about 30 seconds containing a different distracting action. In total, there are around 550 minutes recording for normal driving and 100 minutes recording of anomalous driving in training set. The test set contains 6 subjects and each subject has 6 video recordings lasting around 3.5 minutes. There are 16 distracting actions in test set that are not available in the training set. The complete test consists of 88 minutes recording for normal driving and 45 minutes recording of anomalous driving.
