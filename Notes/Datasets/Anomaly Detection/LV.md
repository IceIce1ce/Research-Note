<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
It comprises video sequences characterized by following aspects:
- Realistic events without actors performing predefined scripts with a diverse subject interaction.
- Highly unpredictable abnormal events in different scenes, some of them of very short duration.
- Scenario correspondence where training and test data are captured from the same scene.
- Challenging environmental conditions, sequences are acquired under changing illumination and camera motion.
The LV dataset consists of 30 sequences with 14 different abnormal events. All sequences in the dataset contain both abnormal and normal behavior. Thus, it is not divided into training and test sequences. The labeled frames are provided along with the dataset. Instead of providing ground truth at pixel-level segmentation of abnormal objects, the ROIs are provided in a separate sequence of the same length as that of the training/testing sequence.
