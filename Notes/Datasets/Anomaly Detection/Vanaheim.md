Several abnormal events have been manually annotated: event-1: one person is loitering/stopping; event-2: three people are stopping; event-3: one person jumps over turnstiles and runs in the opposite direction of people flow; and event-4: one person is stopping. Each video has an approximate length of 10 min.
