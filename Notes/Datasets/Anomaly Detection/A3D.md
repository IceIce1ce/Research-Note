<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
- AnAn Accident Detection (A3D) of on-road abnormal event videos compiled as 1500 video clips from a YouTube channel of dashboard cameras from different cars in East Asia. Each video contains an abnormal traffic event at different temporal locations. 
- It includes a total of 128175 frames (ranging from 23 to 208 frames) at 10 frames per second and is clustered into 18 types of traffic accidents each labeled with a brief description. A3D includes driving scenarios with different weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy,...), places (urban, countryside,...) and participant types (cars, motorcycles, pedestrians, animals,...).
- In addition to start and end times, each traffic anomaly is labeled with a binary value indicating whether the ego-vehicle is involved. Especially, rear-end collisions are the most difficult to detect from traditional anomaly detection methods. About 60% of accidents in the dataset involve the ego-vehicle and others are observed by moving cars from a third-person perspective.
