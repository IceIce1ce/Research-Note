<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
It focuses on aberrant behavior associated with criminal activity. It has around 90000 frames of humans identified by bounding boxes with interacting groups classified into one of 6 different behaviors. It consists of 4 video clips (76800 individual frames). The video and images were recorded at 25 FPS with resolution 640 $\times$ 480. Each interacting person has a bounding box. Altogether, 125 instances of people were marked up for a total of 83545 bounding boxes. The BEHAVE ground truth was constructed using Viper-GT grounding-truthing tool which encodes target positions in an XML variant.
