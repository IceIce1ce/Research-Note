<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
The largest dataset of human actions. It consists of 101 action classes, over 13k clips and 27 hours of video data. The database consists of realistic user-uploaded videos containing camera motion and cluttered background. The dataset is composed of web videos which are recorded in unconstrained environments and typically include camera motion, various lighting conditions, partial occlusion and low quality frames. UCF101's classes are divided into 5 types: human-object interaction, body-motion only, human-human interaction, playing musical instruments and sports. The clips of one action class are divided into 25 groups which contain 4-7 clips each. The clips in one group share some common features such as black-ground or actors. The videos are downloaded from YouTube and irrelevant ones are manually removed. All clips have fixed frame rate and resolution of 25 FPS and 320 $\times$ 240. The videos are saved in .avi files compressed using DivX codec available in k-lite package. The audio is preserved for clips of new 51 actions.
