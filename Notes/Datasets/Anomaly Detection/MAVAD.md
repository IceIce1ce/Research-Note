<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
The dataset is anonymized by blurring faces and license plates to protect the privacy of individuals. It consists of 764 videos gathered from three different locations. Those locations have been chosen with the focus on road traffic, including various types of vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The raw audio and video data was collected from two locations on the island of Malta: one in Zejtun, and another in Mgarr. The data is organized into 11 classes: normal situations, pedestrians, pedestrians crossing the street, vehicles exiting the side street, heavy weight vehicles (trucks, vans, etc.), buses, bicycles, obstructions, uturns, scooters and horses. Videos that do not belong to any specific anomalous class are labeled as “normal”.
