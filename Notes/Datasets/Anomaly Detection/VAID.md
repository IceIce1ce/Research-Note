VAID consists of 1360 images captured by normal cameras and VTSS. In testing dataset, we had 30 videos of accident base and normal flow of traffic. All these videos were recorded by cameras used in VTSSs in different places and under different environmental conditions. The duration of videos in testing dataset range from 4s to 10s. This dataset is divided into two categories, accidents and non-accidents. The accidents category has 20 videos and the non-accident category has 10 videos. A total of 15 videos in the testing dataset were captured by high-resolution cameras (HRCs) during the day and 7 were captured at night through a VTSS. Moreover, the number of videos that were captured by low-resolution cameras (LRCs) during the day is five and during the night is three.
