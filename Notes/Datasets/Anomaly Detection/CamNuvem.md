CamNuvem contains 486 new real-world robbery surveillance videos acquired from public sources. It consists of 972 videos in total, including 486 abnormal videos collected from public sources such as YouTube, Facebook, and other social media websites. The videos were edited to remove useless segments that were not recorded by the surveillance camera, such as introductions and endings. All the abnormal videos consist of people committing robberies. This category of videos was split into 437 videos for the training set and 49 videos (10%) for the test set. This dataset is weakly labelled as UCF-Crime. All videos were adjusted to 320 $\times$ 240 px and 30 fps.
