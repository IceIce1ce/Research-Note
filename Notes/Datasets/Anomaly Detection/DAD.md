<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
The dataset includes 678 dashcam videos with high video quality (720 in resolution) from the web. The dataset has various accidents including 42.6% motorbike hits car, 19.7% car hits car, 15.6% motorbike hits motorbike and 20% other types. Most videos are captured across six cities in Taiwan. Due to the crowded road with many moving objects and complicated street signs/billboards, it is a challenging dataset for vision-based method. For each video, bounding boxes of car, motorbike, bicycle, human and time when accident occurs are provided. 58 out of 678 videos are used only for training the object detector. Among 620 videos, 620 positive clips and 1130 negative clips where each clip consists of 100 frames are manually selected. The number of training clips is roughly three times the number of testing clips (1284 training clips with 455 positive and 829 negative clips and 466 testing clips with 165 positive and 301 negative clips).
