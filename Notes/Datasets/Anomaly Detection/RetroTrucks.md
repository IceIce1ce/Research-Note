All the videos are recorded from truck mounted dashcams. All the anomalies involve the ego-vehicle. All videos are relatively long, ranging from 7 seconds to 2 minutes. The dataset includes abnormal driving scenarios such as collisions, near-misses, road departures, and vehicle rollovers. Any driving scene which does not include such a scenario is included in the normal set. The driving scenes encompass a diverse set of weather and lighting conditions including rural and urban, day and night, and sunny and overcast scenes. 474 videos are collected from YouTube of which 254 are normal and 220 are anomalous. Further, 56 of the anomalous videos are annotated with temporal localization of the accidents in the videos and are used as our testing set, while the rest are provided to enable the development of weakly-supervised approaches which use both normal and anomalous videos at training. All videos have 25 FPS.
