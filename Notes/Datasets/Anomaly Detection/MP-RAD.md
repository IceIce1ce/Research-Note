Each event is captured from 5 independent camera angles resulting a total 2000 video samples. The data collection process foloows a two-step approach: 1) a player drives a vehicle and commits an accident intentionally with nearby vehicles or pedestrians, 2) capture the event from 5 viewing perspectives. The intrinsic and extrinsic params of recording setups (heigh, angle, focus, etc) are random for each event. Temporal annotations of the videos are also provided.
