<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
XD-Violence has a total duration of 217 hours, containing 4754 untrimmed videos with audio signals and weak labels. The dataset is collected from both movies and YouTube (in-the-wild scenes). There is a total of 91 movies of which violent movies are used to collect both violent and non-violent events and non-violent movies are only used to collect non-violent events. It consists of 2405 violent videos and 2349 non-violent videos. The training set contains 3954 videos and testing set contains 800 videos, where test set consists of 500 violent videos and 300 non-violent videos. The frame-level annotations for test videos are also provided. Both training and test sets contain all 6 kinds of violence at various temporal locations in the videos. Source of scenarios: CCTV camera, movies, sports, games, hand-held cameras, CCTV, car cameras, etc. Three advantages: 1) large scale which is beneficial for training generalizable methods for violence detection, 2) diversity of scenarios so that violence detection methods actively respond to complicated and diverse environments and are more robust, 3) containing audio-visual signals, making algorithms leverage multimodal information and more confidence.
