<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
Provide a complete analysis of video anomaly detection systems that employ deep learning that have been published since 2019. In this paper, examine the learning methods as well as the dataset used for training and testing. Along with it, the model's accuracy is described.
<h2>2. Widely utilised video anomaly datasets</h2>
UCSD, UMN, UCF Crime, ShanghaiTech, Avenue and XD dataset.
<h2>3. Evaluation metrics and trends</h2>
<h3>3.1 Evaluation metrics</h3>
ROC, AUC, ERR and F1 Score.
<h3>3.2 Trends</h3>
Transfer learning, autoencoders and GANs.
