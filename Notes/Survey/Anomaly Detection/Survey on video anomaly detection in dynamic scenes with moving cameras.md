<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
Present the first comprehensive survey on Moving Camera Video Anomaly Detection. It encompasses three application domains: security, urban transportation, and marine environments, which in turn cover six specific tasks. Compile an extensive list of 25 publicly-available datasets spanning four distinct environments: underwater, water surface, ground, and aerial.
<h2>2. Approaches</h2>
Categorize MC-VAD approaches into scene-level, which focus on detecting frame-level anomalies, and scenario-level, which focus on detecting temporal-level anomalies. Scene-level anomalies are the result of deviations from normal patterns that can be detected in a single video frame. Crowd counting and density estimation techniques can be exploited for detecting anomalies in these types of scenarios. Scenario-level anomalies result from unusual movements or unexpected events that necessitate temporal information for detection. These anomalies can be detected based on the analysis of individual motions, such as oscillatory features, trajectory features or the temporal accumulation of intersecting motions. MC-VAD methods can be further classified into five categories based on the type of anomaly: semantic segmentation-based, reference frame-based, background separation-based, object trajectory-based and interaction-based.
<h3>2.1 Based on semantic segmentation</h3>
Segmentation-based methods exploit pixel-level labels for the detection and localization of scene-level anomalies, particularly for tasks such as obstacle detection and the recognition of anomalous or novel objects. These methods primarily focus on single image frames, not utilizing temporal information, which can lead to inaccurate detections in cases where cameras move under various lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. Additionally, training these methods may require a substantial amount of annotated datasets, necessitating efforts associated with dataset collection and annotation.
<h3>2.2 Based on reference frames</h3>
Reference frame-based methods can serve for anomaly detection within specific environments. They are particularly effective in cases where scene changes are minimal, such as unmanned workshops or industrial parks. In these scenarios, autonomous patrolling can be used for anomaly detection, as normal conditions can be predefined and recorded in reference frames. Initially, the accuracy of these methods significantly relied on the alignment accuracy between reference frames and target frames. However, advancements in deep learning techniques have gradually reduced this dependency, expanding their applicability across various scenarios.
<h3>2.3 Based on background separation</h3>
Background-based methods in MC-VAD require object detection in order to detect foreground objects. In traffic scenes, anomalies are often associated with accidents, which can be detected by analyzing motion patterns. In security surveillance scenes, direct analysis of skeletal features in human bodies allows for the inclusion of more compact and valuable information. These methods heavily rely on the accuracy of foreground detection. In situations where occlusions or crowds are present, the accuracy of anomaly detection can be affected.
<h3>2.4 Based on object trajectories</h3>
These methods leverage object trajectories for anomaly detection, reducing the dependency on pixellevel differences and background changes. Yet, the performance of the final task, whether it is behavior prediction or analysis, is closely linked to the performance of other processing modules, such as object detection, object tracking, and ego-motion/odometry estimation.
<h3>2.5 Based on object interactions</h3>
Methods based on object interactions in MC-VAD offer the distinctive advantage of providing an additional layer of contextual information through the analysis of relationships between objects. These methods are capable of detecting anomalies that might be overlooked by other approaches and often synergize effectively with methods that focus on object trajectories. They face challenges such as the limited availability of contextual anomaly datasets and the potential for occlusions in moving camera scenarios to adversely affect the accuracy of anomaly detection.
<h2>3. Outlook</h2>
<h3>3.1 Limitations of existing works</h3>
Firstly, they are often restricted to detecting only a handful of specific anomaly categories. Secondly, they frequently suffer from poor generalizability. They are also particularly vulnerable to a variety of external factors such as changes in illumination, obstructions, and complex background scenarios. Specifically, most semantic segmentation methods are only capable of detecting appearance anomalies at the scene level, such as the presence of abnormal objects. They are limited in their ability to handle other types of scene-level anomalies that involve motion and span across consecutive frames. Furthermore, these methods often fail to effectively utilize temporal information, resulting in the loss of abnormal targets in certain frames due to occlusion, light reflections, and other interfering factors. Methods based on reference frames are limited by the requirement of reference videos that do not contain any anomalies. They are prone to false positives when the scene undergoes significant changes or when normal objects that were not present in the reference frames appear frequently. However, the methods based on background separation, object trajectory and object interaction are affected by the effects of low-level algorithms such as detection and tracking, and have high requirements for data quality.
