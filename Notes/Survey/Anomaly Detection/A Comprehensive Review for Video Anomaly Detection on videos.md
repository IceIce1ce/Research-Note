<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
Survey the last three years, a comprehensive study of detecting video anomalies and the dataset which is used for this purpose recently. Moreover, a comparison study on different approaches have been performed which are used for anomalies detection. 
<h2>2. Video anomalies classification</h2>
<h3>2.1 Global and local anomalies</h3>
Local anomaly detection is the process of identifying local anomalous behavior in an individual or a group of people. Global anomaly detection is the technique of identifying people's global anomalous behavior in surveillance recordings.
<h3>2.2 Point and interaction anomalies</h3>
The point anomaly is a randomly anomaly that can be further translated into an abnormal activity displayed by a person such as loitering.
<h3>2.3 Conditional or contextual anomalies</h3>
The context is identified by behavioral features and contextual features. Behavioral features are qualities that are used to define normal activities while time and space are considered contextual features.
<h2>3. Performance evaluation methodologies</h2>
<h3>3.1 Database</h3>
UCSD Pedestrian dataset, Subway dataset, Avenue dataset, UMN dataset, BOSS dataset, Weizmann dataset, ShanghaiTech dataset, UCF-Crime, RWF-2000 database, LAD database and UBI-Fights.
<h3>3.2 Evaluation criteria</h3>
Three assessment criteria: frame level anomaly is identified for at least one pixel in a frame, pixel-level is identified for 40% or more of the label of the pixel as anomalies, dual-pixel-level: the frame must meet the PL evaluation requirements. And at least 10% of the pixels detected as the anomaly and object-level is utilized to detect anomalous frames with the detected abnormality area (DAA) close to the true abnormality area (TAA).
