<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
This survey concentrates on DL application in finding the exact count, involved individuals and the occurred activity on a larger crowd at every climate condition. The fundamental DL implementation technology concerned in disparate crowd video analysis is discussed. Moreover, it presented the available datasets as well as metrics for performance evaluation and also described examples of prevailing VS systems utilized in the real life. Lastly, challenges together with propitious directions for additional research are outlined.
