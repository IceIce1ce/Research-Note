<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
Study the most recent techniques based on computer vision to monitor and detect traffic offenses, lighting the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, additionally provide research a comparison and study basis to facilitate their future work also improve robust approaches to detect road violations.
<h2>2. Results analysis</h2>
- Types of violation: stop line violation, red light violation, over speed detection, sudden change of trajectory, a one-way violation detection.
- Specific technique: Adaptive background subtraction method, compare RGB and HSV color of traffic light to a threshold, frame difference in hue based on HSV color of image, tensorflow object detection, Faster RCN bost dataset, mobile net SSD, haar cascade, SSD model COCO, YOLOv3.
<h2>3. Future work</h2>
Developing some ameliorated approaches based on artificial intelligence algorithms to detect vehicles that cross the stop signs further the duplication of vehicles in a banned place taking into consideration all real lighting conditions.
