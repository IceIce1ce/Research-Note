<h2>1. Deep learning in anomaly detection for videos</h2>
Reconstruction error, future frame prediction, classifiers, scoring methods.
<h2>2. Datasets</h2>
UCSD, UMN, CUHK Avenue, Subway, ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime and Street Scene.
<h2>3. Evaluation metrics</h2>
AUC-ROC, EER, TPR, FPR, TBDR, RBDR.
<h2>4. Discussion</h2>
One common theme from all papers is that most of them still are careful about talking into account several aspects of human action such as appearance and motion. Representations may differ such as using social force maps or optical flows but the main idea remains the same. Recent papers have started to think of creating end-to-end deep learning solutions and unified architectures rather than making use of separate components in a traditional pipeline.
